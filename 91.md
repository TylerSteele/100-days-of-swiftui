# 91 - [Project 17, part 6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/91)

10 days left! It's so close I can taste the pie. I do only have 9 calerdar days left, but as long as I can keep up my momentum I should be able to pull this off.

This question/answer is funny:

> Option 2: When allowsHitTesting() is false, a view cannot be tapped.
> Correct: Any taps simply pass through to whatever is stacked below.

I didn't choose this option because my thinking was "Well, you can still tap it, it just passes through."

11/12 on this quiz.

Okay, I got challenge 1 and 2 working. But challenge 3 will not bend to my will. I submitted a question to the forum (actually added to an existing conversation on the same exact topic) here https://www.hackingwithswift.com/forums/100-days-of-swiftui/project-17-challenge-3-cardview-is-not-shown-when-removing-and-inserting-a-card-into-the-cards-array/28337/28476

Now, because someone else is having this issue, it makes me feel better about just skipping it for now. I really cannot spend more time on this. What's so disheartening is, if I can't figure out this simple operation in SwiftUI, how will I build complex apps? Updating an array and having the change apply to the view should be the most basic of things, but nope...

Hopefully there's some particular weirdness to this project that makes it not work (and makes the problem completely opaque to me). I am not feeling good about SwiftUI right now on day 91 :(

UPDATE: I did recieve the help I needed to get Challenge 3 working! The solution was to change the ID of the incorrect flash card that gets pushed to the front of the array. Now, I'm glad I got this working and I'm very grateful to MrNumbers over at the forum, but this solution is _dumb_. Surely a ForEach should rerender on the the reording of a list of identifiable objects??? That's like, one of it's jobs, no? And changing an ID for the sake of a rendering engine when the object itself is in fact the same feels really gross to me. Nonetheless, I'm happy to have closed the loop on this one. The lesson is not so much about ForEach, but it's about the power of the kindness of strangers.
