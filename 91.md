# 91 - [Project 17, part 6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/91)

10 days left! It's so close I can taste the pie. I do only have 9 calerdar days left, but as long as I can keep up my momentum I should be able to pull this off.

This question/answer is funny:

> Option 2: When allowsHitTesting() is false, a view cannot be tapped.
> Correct: Any taps simply pass through to whatever is stacked below.

I didn't choose this option because my thinking was "Well, you can still tap it, it just passes through."

11/12 on this quiz.

Okay, I got challenge 1 and 2 working. But challenge 3 will not bend to my will. I submitted a question to the forum (actually added to an existing conversation on the same exact topic) here https://www.hackingwithswift.com/forums/100-days-of-swiftui/project-17-challenge-3-cardview-is-not-shown-when-removing-and-inserting-a-card-into-the-cards-array/28337/28476

Now, because someone else is having this issue, it makes me feel better about just skipping it for now. I really cannot spend more time on this. What's so disheartening is, if I can't figure out this simple operation in SwiftUI, how will I build complex apps? Updating an array and having the change apply to the view should be the most basic of things, but nope...

Hopefully there's some particular weirdness to this project that makes it not work (and makes the problem completely opaque to me). I am not feeling good about SwiftUI right now on day 91 :(
