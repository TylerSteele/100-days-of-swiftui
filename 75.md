# 75 - [Project 15, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/75)

I don't think I've used the default syntax for dictionary access before, or at least I didn't remember.

```swift
labels[countries[number], default: "Unknown flag"]
```

I thought that I was passing default as an argument to `accessibilityLabel` so it tripped me up for a bit.

I forgot all about WordScramble. I guess I have been doing this for a while.

I will say, these accessibily changes are so simple and easy to implement, I wonder if it would be better to integrate them into the original lessons. It's not all that distracting, and it better undercores the innate expectation for apps to be accessible.
