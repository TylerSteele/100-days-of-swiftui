# Day 21 - [Project 2, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/21)

This was a nice exercise in styling options. I was also happy to see the gradients in action. And, I learned some country flags!

The logic for selecting random flags by just generating a random number between 1 and 3 and then shuffling the entire array is not something I would've thought of doing. Instead, I would've generated three random numbers and kept track, which would have complicated things. I like this approach!
