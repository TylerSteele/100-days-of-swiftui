# 67 - [Project 13, part 6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/67)

11/12 on the review!

I improved upon the challenge by conditionally showing the specific sliders only if the selected filter contained the relevat input key.

I added Dither, Disc Blur, and Bloom as my three additional filters. I still can't tell why Edges turns the entire image black. I tried drastically reducing intensity and the outcome is the same. Oh! If I increase intensity I can see the effect. Weird. I guess the scale is sort of inverse for edges?
