# 79 - [Project 16, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/79)

I missed yesterday because I cut my finger and had to go to the ER... I think I'll cut myself some slack for that :hocho:

Luckily, today's lessons were short and sweet. I'm excited about tabs. I probably like tabs too much and risk overusing them, but I'm definitely going to consider them for my app.
