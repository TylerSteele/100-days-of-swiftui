# Day 43 - [Project 9, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/43)

I'm glad I'm learning about NavigationLink and rendering immediately without specifying a navigationDestination.

Ioday's lessons were nice and short. It's nice to have a break. I do wonder if I'm missing an example of making something hashable that isn't just adding `: Hashable` to a struct. Is it just that, for nested structs, each child struct also needs to be hashable? Or is there some other way of making something conform to hashable with a special function?
