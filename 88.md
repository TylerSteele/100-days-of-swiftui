# 88 - [Project 17, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/88)

The stacked extension, or extensions like it, is an interesting way of handling 'for each' style displays that would be cumbersome in a classic View.

This is looking good. I always enjoy animations that I can play with without doing any real actions, so setting the threshold before a card is actually deleted makes sense.
