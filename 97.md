# 97 - [Milestone: Project 19, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/97)

Huh, the fact that static lets are lazy by default is nice. I wonder what else is lazy that I don't know about? Certainly not me, I'm not lazy :sweat_smile:

The list type is a wonderful feature that I feel like you wouldn't see in other frameworks. It so obvious and common of a problem, too. Love the simplicity of this:

```swift
Text(resort.facilities, format: .list(type: .and))
```
