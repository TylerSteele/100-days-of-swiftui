# 68 - [Project 14, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/68)

Here's my solution to the challenge at the end of "Writing data to the documents directory"

```swift
extension FileManager {
    func loadDocument(_ file: String) -> String? {
        let url = URL.documentsDirectory.appending(path: file)
        do {
            let output = try String(contentsOf: url)
            return output
        } catch {
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        }
        return nil
    }
}
```

I didn't decode, but I don't think he meant that.

Xcode's autocomplete of a switch statement given an enum is really neat.
