# Day 19 - [Challenge day](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/19)

While I'm submitting this a day late, I did in fact complete this challenge yesterday on the road an the way to a Hozier concert :notes:

This was a fun challenge and I'm happy with how easily I handled the SwiftUI portion. The biggest difficulty was the conversion logic. I decided to add a scale and with incremental differences where so I didn't have to map out specific conversions. Many off-by-one errors later, and I got it working!
