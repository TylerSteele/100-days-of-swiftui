# Day 51 - [Project 10, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/51)

What is the difference between `@Binding` and `@Bindable`? Oh, he has an article for that :) https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftdata/whats-the-difference-between-bindable-and-binding

I'm not sure what this is referring to:

> Previously I mentioned that onAppear() didnâ€™t work with these asynchronous functions, and we needed to use the task() modifier instead.

I'm pretty sure this wasn't covered. I'm curious how tasks work with Async. Is this like event loops in Python?

All done, but I do have one unresolved bug that I'll have to take on tomorrow.
