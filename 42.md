# Day 42 - [Project 8, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/42)

42 is my favorite number <3

11/12 on the quiz today. Again, I should've gotten 12/12 but I didn't take my time with the last question.

For the list and grid view toggle button, I downloaded the SF Symbols app to find the best icons. It's such a nice resource, I'm looking forward to discovering all of the different icon options.
