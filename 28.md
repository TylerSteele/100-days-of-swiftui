# Day 28 - [Project 4, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/28)

I got 11/12 on the quiz. Not bad, but I was just too hasty on the one I got wrong. Something odd is I periodically get expired SSL cert warnings from the hackingwithswift site today.

I completed the third challenge with the `onChange` modifier, which I'm pretty sure hasn't been introduced yet. But I'm not really sure how I'd recalculate without that? I guess by making it a computed property. Let me try that.

Yeah, I suppose that's better :)
