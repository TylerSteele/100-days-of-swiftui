# Day 48 - [Expanding your horizons](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/48)

Video day! This feels like when you see the TV rolled into the classroom. It's nice to have the break.

The Star Wars presentation was nice, the amount of work that must have went into that is astounding. The whole thing with protocols specifying whether the default function definition should be preferred... I had to watch that section twice. And I'm not sure I agree that that set up allows you to be more declaritive. I guess it does, but it also allows you to be more confusing.

Steve's short video was endearing and inspiring. I like the emphasis on code being creative when so much of the community is seeking 'the definitive best way to do x' which is more about conforming to a norm.
