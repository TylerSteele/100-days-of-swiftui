# 81 - [Project 16, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/81)

Love another learning day. The notifications interface is simple. I can see how I'll use that in my app. Funnily enough, I haven't even considered what third party packages may exist for Swift / SwiftUI. Looking forward to finding out!
