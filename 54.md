# Day 54 - [Project 11, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/54)

Passing in constant binding values with `.constant(4)` is really nice for previews.

It's nice to know that he too has to add the awkward `+ 1` to the ForEach range when using a custom max. I thought I was missing something when I did that last time.

```swift
ForEach(1..<maximumRating + 1, id: \.self) { number in
```

Wow, the issue with tapping within a form activating all star buttons is something I definitely would've gotten tripped up on.

> "Now, how would I know that?" You wouldn't. It's normal to not know things.

This feels true and reasonable in a broad sense, but I do feel like this is going to be a problem for me using SwiftUI. Or at least, the tradeoff. Because so much is abstracted away, the knowlege of innerworkings and fundamentals is almost discouraged. Which means when something doesn't work as you expect, it's not easy to peel back the layers and clarify your gap in understanding.

My preview keeps crashing on saving the book. Maybe this is expecting when trying to interact with SwiftData in a preview? Or it's just an XCode bug. Meh.
