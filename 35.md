This Maya Angelou quote cuts deep... Ahhh, I have to think about this one.

It is odd that ForEach doesn't work with a ClosedRange. I'm glad the author says he hopes this will change, because it's often hard to understand if something is thoughtfully designed for reasons I don't yet know, or if the implementation just hasn't caught up with the thoughtful design. This seems like the latter and his comment reaffirms that.

I appreciate the discussion on Strings in Swift. I think my computer science background makes Swift challenging to learn without detailed breakdowns like this, because often the functionality and limitations defy 'normal' programming expectations.

I really like the resource directory containing every file regardless of organization, because like I said earlier, I'm sick of dealing with file paths to local content.

I really don't have the time or energy to get into this whole project tonight. Weekends are tough, especially when I save the work for the end of the day. So I'm going to continue with tomorrow's lesson and try to also make substantial progress on the project. Let's see how that goes.
