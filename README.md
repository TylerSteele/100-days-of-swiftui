# 100 Days of SwiftUI

This repository tracks my progress in the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course. I will use this space to journal on my daily progress and hold myself accountable to my goal.

## Stated Goal

While the idea is to complete this in 100 days, I want to get ahead of the fact that life has a way of getting in the way. In order to stay focused on the goal without self-flagellating my way across the finish line, I'm going to set a completion date 120 days from my start date (tomorrow).

That date happens to be **_10/31/24_** :jack_o_lantern:

If I fail to achieve my goal, I pledge to abstain from eating any Halloween candy in 2024 (either the day of or leftover candy later). The real motivation here is to become competent in SwiftUI, but in my weaker moments I care more deeply about candy. :no_entry_sign: :candy:

Wish me luck!

## Update - 9/2/2024

After doing this for 50 days, I'm beginning to feel like a change is in order. I don't have any issues with weekdays, but on weekends and holidays it's always a scramble to squeeze in time to work on this. While this is doable, it's preventing me from enjoying my days off as I should.

In an effort to prioritize being present with my family, I'm going to amend the stated goal and change the due date to **_11/28/24_** so that I can meet the goal while only working on business days. If I miss this goal, I vow to not eat any pie :pie: between Thanksgiving and the end of the year. I'd argue that this raises the stakes because pie is amazing.
