# 100 Days of SwiftUI

This repository tracks my progress in the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course. I will use this space to journal on my daily progress and hold myself accountable to my goal.

## Stated Goal

While the idea is to complete this in 100 days, I want to get ahead of the fact that life has a way of getting in the way. In order to stay focused on the goal without self-flagellating my way across the finish line, I'm going to set a completion date 120 days from my start date (tomorrow).

That date happens to be **_10/31/24_** :jack_o_lantern:

If I fail to achieve my goal, I pledge to abstain from eating any Halloween candy in 2024 (either the day of or leftover candy later). The real motivation here is to become competent in SwiftUI, but in my weaker moments I care more deeply about candy. :no_entry_sign: :candy:

Wish me luck!

## Update - 9/2/2024

After doing this for 50 days, I'm beginning to feel like a change is in order. I don't have any issues with weekdays, but on weekends and holidays it's always a scramble to squeeze in time to work on this. While this is doable, it's preventing me from enjoying my days off as I should.

In an effort to prioritize being present with my family, I'm going to amend the stated goal and change the due date to **_11/28/24_** so that I can meet the goal while only working on business days. If I miss this goal, I vow to not eat any pie :pie: between Thanksgiving and the end of the year. I'd argue that this raises the stakes because pie is amazing.

## Completion - 11/24/2024

I started this journey on July 2nd, 2024, and after 145 days I've completed achieved my goal! I scored a 94/100 on the final exam and earned my certificate.

I'd like to thank Paul Hudson for his gift of free, high quality education. I have progressed further and faster than I would have with self-guided learning. In fact, I would have grown discouraged and distracted by the next shiny object a long time ago without this structure and path in place. And yes, 145 days is 45 more days than 100. But I still learned 100% of the material on my time and, most importantly, I stuck with it even after I slipped up. Persistence over perfection, every time.

Look out, App Store, I'm coming.
