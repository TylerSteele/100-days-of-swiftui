I appreciate that he's giving small 'production ready' tips as we go, like moving button logic into a named function.

I find it weird that you set an image into a filter object as opposed to running an image through a filter function or setting a filter on an image object. Oh wow, this is even weirder looking at the syntax. Also lol at Paul's bafflement about the broken filter function.
