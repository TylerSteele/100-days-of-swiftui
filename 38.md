# Day 38 - [Project 7, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/38)

I scored a 10/12 on the quiz today, not bad. I also finally emailed HackingWithSwift about their expired certificate. I had to refresh and it make me lose progress on my quiz.

So I did all of the challenges, including the last, but I'm not sure what he means here:

> For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted!

I created an ExpenseList view that only renders the given expense type. Deleting seems to work fine like this and I don't see why it wouldn't work? I also can't really imagine a solution where that would be a problem? If you stored a personal list and a business list, that wouldn't be a problem. This is why I wish there were sample solutions or at least elaborations on the design.
