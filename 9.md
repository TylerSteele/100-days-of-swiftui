# Day 9 - [Closures](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/9)

Today was a breeze as I already covered this subject in the 100 Days of Swift. More exposure is good, though, considering the uniqueness of Swift's closure syntax. The Checkpoint was a good reinforcement of it. I'm especially not used to dropping the parentheses around the closure.

I had this:

```swift
luckyNumbers
    .filter({ $0 % 2 == 1})
    .sorted(by: {$0 < $1})
    .map({"\($0) is a lucky number"})
    .forEach({ print($0) })
```

before I realized I could convert it to:

```swift
luckyNumbers
    .filter
        { $0 % 2 == 1}
    .sorted
        { $0 < $1 }
    .map
        { "\($0) is a lucky number" }
    .forEach
        { print($0) }
```

While it takes up a lot more space, I do think it's nice and readable. You could achieve a similar thing with the parentheses in there, but with the line breaks they don't really add any value.
