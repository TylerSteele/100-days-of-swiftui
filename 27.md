# Day 27 - [Project 4, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/27)

I missed another day yesterday. It was a very full day: beach day and movie night. I didn't have any spare time so I'm okay with missing this day, but I need to keep an eye on how many extra days I have.

Changing defaultWakeUpTime to a static variable is such a great thing to understand. I've had the problem where I want to create a default without really knowing how to get it to compile. I think before I just moved the default out of the class.

The auto pluralization is awesome. It's like whoever designed Swift has the same nit-picky sensibilities as me.
