# 58 - [Project 12, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/58)

I did miss yesterday because my son was sick and I had to take care of him. I really struggle with striking a balance with streaks. The stringency is part of what keeps me motivated, but I worry that the self-inflicted guilt for missing a day, and how that bleeds into my daily mood, can outweigh the value that the streak is trying to achieve in the first place. Especially when the missed days are justified. I am my own harshest critic, and obviously this entire structure is my own fabrication, but without it I don't think I'd have made it to day 58. Some part of me wonders if I should be investing energy into finding a pursuit that genuinely interests to the point of manifesting motivation. The struggle is that we are inundated with media (movies, TV, video games, etc.) that will always be more 'motivating' than challenging, developmental activities. I think, if we look back on history's great inventions, we'll find a commonality in boredom being an incubator for discovery. If entertainment is the norm instead of the exception, what does that do to society's creativity?

I've toyed with the idea of living without a TV and eradicating all non-fulfilling distractions. I already gave up alcohol, imposed strict phone limits, and set parental controls on my video game consoles. But there's something to be said for time spent decompressing, and the value in appreciating art. I am truly at a loss for where the middle ground is. Perhaps it is the striving toward it.

At the very least, I resolve to finish this 100 days challenge. Then, I will re-assess. I just googled it and Walden Pond is only an hour and twenty minute drive away. Something to think about.

It's nice how easily SwiftData handles adding a new relationship. Declaring a cascade delete relationship is straightforward, too.

I don't have the option to add iCloud sync so I skipped that portion of this lesson.
