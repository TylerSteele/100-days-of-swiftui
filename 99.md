# 99 - [Milestone: Project 19, part 4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/99)

10/12 today on the quiz.

I was trying to use `.position()` within a `ZStack` for the picture credit, but setting the `ZStack` to `ZStack(alignment: .bottomTrailing)` is soooo much better.

I've done it! All challenges complete!!
