# Day 16 - [Project 1, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/16)

I'm excited to start the new project! Today, I solidified my understanding of things I've already seen in SwiftUI but not really read into, like the `@State` wrapper and passing in a value with `$`. I also did some extra reading on keypaths `\.id` and it's a pretty neat feature. Protocols that can conform to rather different classes.
