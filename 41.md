# Day 41 - [Project 8, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/41)

Another project done! This one still feels basic in terms of it being a non-interactive, basic navigation app. However, I get the sense that complex data management is coming!

Thank you to all of the NASA missions and related technological advances that allowed me to live my comfortable life.
