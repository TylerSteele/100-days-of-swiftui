# 73 - [Project 14, part 6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/73)

I feel like if I were designing this course, I would sneak in surprise 'fun' days where you only have to watch a video or take a break. That would keep me engaged to see what today's lesson was even if I wasn't feeling motivated that day.

That being said, I have missed a few days at this point. So I'll have to do overtime in November to catch up. Less than one month left! Crunch time will be good for me.

11/12 on the review.

I cannot get the Face ID to work in the simulator. It keeps hitting a hard error. I'll have to test this on my actual device.

I don't love how my map style select works, but it works.

After setting the the EditView ViewModel the code ran successfully the first time. Woo!
