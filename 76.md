# 76 - [Project 15, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/76)

I scored 11/12 on the quiz.

I downloaded an update for my OS and simulators, and now I can't seem to launch apps in the simulator :( I think I'll have to use my physical device for now.

I wasn't sure about how to add accessibility to the astronaut's portrait. For now, I just set it to accessibilityHidden because I figure saying "Portrait of (name)" and then "(name)" is not helpful. Ideally, the raw data would contain written visual descriptions of each astronaut and that would be required. That's how I would handle it if this were a real app.
