# Day 25 - [Milestone: Projects 1-3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/25)

Something I'm beginning to appreciate about this course is the insistance on teaching the underpinnings of each bit of functionality. It would be so much easier, and this is often what you find in other online 'coding tutorials', to simply explain how to use each tool without delving into how each tool works or why they are designed that way.

This is proving to be not just a masterclass in Swift, but also an example of masterful lesson planning and technical writing.

Making the Rock Paper Scissors app was fun. The idea is a little confusing. I thought at first that you were supposed to hide the defending hand from the player, but then it's purely 1 in 3 random. But by revealing the hand, I do feel like there should be a timer running or something. I opted not to add alerts in and to just let the round auto restart because I prefer the seamless loop.

Here's my design:
