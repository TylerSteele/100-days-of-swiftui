# 60 - [Milestone: Projects 10-12](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/60)

One more missed day yesterday, putting me in debt for 3 days based on how many business days I have between now and Thanksgiving. I spent much of my time helping my wife, who's now sick, picking up groceries and hunting for medicine. Covid, or whatever this illness is, is affecting everyone in our house. The symptoms come and go unpredictably. Like life itself, I must go on despite the fact that failure is a guarantee. Not total failure, but failure here and there that mark the path to success.

A recent Twenty One Pilots lyric has been resonating with me and my growth journey:

> Make an oath, then make mistakes  
> Start a streak you're bound to break  
> When darkness rolls on you  
> Push on through  
> Push on through

Today's 100 days of SwiftUI quite is also appropriate:

> I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.

Although here Neil Gaiman is talking about mistakes in doing things, whereas I'm struggling with failure to fulfill a commitment. I suppose you could look at 100 Days of SwiftUI as a literal learning journey (learning SwiftUI) and a meta learning journey (learning self-discipline and persistence). In that sense, I am making active mistakes in the path to self-discipline and to keep going in spite of that is really what persistence is about.

As today is a new challenge day, I'm forced to reckon with the fact that I still haven't completed the two prior challenges. If I may, I think this text

> Note: Don’t worry if you don’t complete challenges in the day they were assigned – in future days you’ll find you have some time to spare here and there, so challenges are something you can return back to in the future.

is inconsistent the otherwise tightly structured lesson planning. While it's true that I have had time after previous lessons to go back and work on the challenges, it never feels urgent because 'in future days you'll find you have some time to spare here and there'. So I say 'Not today, thank you, but I'll work on it in future days'. And then I don't work on it :)

If I were organizing this lesson, I would block off 2 or 3 days dedicated to challenge work. If you complete it in a day, you get a little break. If you don't, you have designated time to work on it and a firm endpoint.

That being said, I'm going to work with my wife to see about carving out time to catch up on these challenges. This will be, well, challenging, given our lower energy and illness, but I'm running out of time.
