# 63 - [Project 13, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/63)

When I was working on my own before 100 days of swift, one of my problems was understanding the differences between all of the different `Color`s and `Image`s in swift. Knowing the source and application of each will make dealing with them a lot easier.

It's not soooo bad converting the image through various forms once you know how to do it. But this is precisely the kind of thing that would disengage me from a project if I ran into this on my own :skull:

`ContentUnavailableView` is great to have. I feel like that's such a common scenario to run into.
