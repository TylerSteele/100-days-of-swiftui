# Day 7 - [Functions, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/7)

As I mentioned, this just review for me at this point. Some things I liked was a clarifying reminder on the distinction between 'argument' and 'parameter' (internal vs external). I also find it interesting that tuples in Swift are more like dicts in Python or objects in JavaScript. I really like the design in Swift, with both labels and the ability to access properties by index.

I did miss a couple of days due to a hectic couple of days at home, but this is me getting back on track! I also completed the two checkpoints so I'm officially caught up.
