# Day 22 - [Project 2, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/22)

I did miss yesterday :( I had a busy day and didn't prioritize completing this challenge. I resolve to do better!

This time I got 10/12 on the quiz, mostly because I wasn't taking enough time on the questions.

I completed the challenges but there's one annoying thing I couldn't figure out: some times the 'Game over' message will pop up before the final 'Correct'/'Incorrect' message will show up. I tried setting the `gameOver` flag on `didSet` of `showingScore` when the score was set to false, but apparently `didSet` isn't triggered by the alert setting the binded variable to false...

I also tried changing the order of the alerts, but that doesn't seem to work either.

So, honestly, I have no idea how to fix this. I guess I could just not show the `showingScore` on the final question, but I would like to better understand this. I'm going to hope I learn the solution to this later and can return to fix this.
