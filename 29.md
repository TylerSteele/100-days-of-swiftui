# Day 29 - [Project 5, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/29)

This is a lot of review of things I've used before in terms of string manipulation. The URL functionality is interesting, it seems like loading in a static file is straightforward and doensn't require the trail and error of local pathing.

The spell checking functionality is really interesting. I'm guessing this is just leveraging whatever iOS does to spell check. It's cool that this is exposed to developers. One thing I find interesting is that we need to use the Objective-C version. Will it not be ported to Swift? Is there a reason why it hasn't been ported already?
