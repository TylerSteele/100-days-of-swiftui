# Day 11 - [Structs, part two](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/11)

Today, I learned about struct access control and static properties / methods. I really like the syntax of Swift's static methods, it avoids something like Python's slightly awkward `cls` variable. The references to `Self` as opposed to `self` also feels like an elegant solution to the class vs instance reference problem. One thing of note is the `fileprivate` flag to indicate that something should only be accessible to everything in that file. I wonder if this hints to some opinionated design around how code should be organized in files. I like the idea of a language that commits to a particular file structure / code organization ideology so I can spend less time thinking about it. But I may be reading too much into `fileprivate` here.
