# Day 32 - [Project 6, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/32)

This was a fun little day of experimenting with animations. I do love how easy Swift makes it on you. It feels like the risk is less that you'll under-animate and more that you'll over-animate given how easy it is.

There's so much potential for simple, attractive, and creative animations that require only a few lines of code.
