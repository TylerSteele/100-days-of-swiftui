# Day 45 - [Project 9, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/45)

I'm happy to learn all of the ways to customize the navigation bar. I especially like the semantic options of button placements so I can worry less about the many possible platform considerations when placing navigation bar buttons.

And this is becoming a theme, but I also like how few customization options there are. It's going to allow me to focus my creative on where it should be while ensuring that something as fundamental to the experience as navigation isn't marred by my poor design choices.
