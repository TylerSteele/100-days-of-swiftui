# 95 - [Milestone: Projects 16-18](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/95)

The final challenge project is today. Here's hoping it doesn't turn into a time sink. I only have 4 days left until Thanksgiving :0

> Using sensory feedback to make iPhones vibrate

Wait, did we do this? I don't really remember that lol. I might have done that on the simulation because I feel like I would've remembered that on a physical device.

Ahhh `compactMap` is really nice. It's great that swift provides this out of the box.

> Result has an initializer that accepts a throwing closure

Wowww. That's sick. One lesson I've learned doing this challenge and journaling on it is that I don't have that many ways of articulating "That's cool". Lol.

Last challenge project complete! I could cry :')
