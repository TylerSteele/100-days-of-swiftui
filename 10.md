# Day 10 - [Structs, part one](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/10)

I'm getting this one in under the wire, but I did complete the lessons on the way to the beach earlier today. Again, I love how Swift's design enforces consistency at every turn with the `mutating` keyword. The getter/setter syntax is beautiful. And the `willUpdate` and `didUpdate` functions allow seamless reactivity. I do wonder how slippery of a slope that stands to become when managing performance in complex applications.
