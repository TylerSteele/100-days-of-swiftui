# 78 - [Time for MapKit](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/78)

Oh boy, more work! Lol, that's not the attitude. The overwhelm is sinking in, and today's election results are helping me focus.

However, I'm happy to report that I'm making progress on the HabitTracker app. In order to ensure I have time to do everything, I'm going to keep it minimal and use the iExpenses app as a template. So far, I've ported all existing iExpenses functionality over to a new app and broken out the components more.

As for this project, we'll get to it when we get to it. Ideally in time for pie.
