# 72 - [Project 14, part 5](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/72)

Yes, I love the demonstration of bringing the data logic into the ViewModel. I'll be referring back to this example when I build my app, although I hope I leave with a more complex example.

Apparently I need a MacOS update in order to get FaceID working in the simulator. That's odd. I'll check that the code is working tomorrow after the update is done.
