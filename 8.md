# Day 8 - [Functions, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/8)

The biggest takeaway I have today is a great appreciation for Swift's `throws` keyword. It's really nice to have a enforcement that, if a function potentially throws, it must be wrapped in a do/catch.

The other thing that struck me is this odd reading of this quote:

> Today you’re going to learn about handling errors in functions. That might sound awfully pessimistic, but as John Lennon said “life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans” – no one wants problems, but life has a habit of finding them anyway!

I mean, I think John Lennon's talking about living in the moment and enjoying life as it happens. Not about 'errors' that might come up. In fact, the quote implicitly suggest we should be making fewer plans and doing more living, which could be interpreted as a call to worry less about error handling.
