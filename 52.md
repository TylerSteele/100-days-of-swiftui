# Day 52 - [Project 10, part 4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/52)

I missed two days for my son's birthday and then birthday party, which I think was worth the break :)

I scored 10/12 on this quiz, which is pretty good.

I'm all set with the challenges, although I'm not happy with how I saved the addresss in UserDefaults. I just reused a ton of boiler plate. But I'm honestly not interested in finding a 'good' way to do this because it feels like a misuse of UserDefaults.
