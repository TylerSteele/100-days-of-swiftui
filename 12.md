# Day 12 - [Classes](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/12)

I actually was under the assumption that Swift structs _were_ Swift's 'classes' for a sec. But now that I think about it, I remember seeing both classes and structs when working with SwiftUI and being confused by the difference. It makes sense to me that structs are able to be 'deeply constant' given that they cannot inherit or be inherited from, whereas for classes, that's not so easy.

It's funny, I really like the `@override` flag when that was added to python. I wonder they just lifted that idea from Swift. It seems like many of these Swift features could be added to future python versions.

I do find it interesting that "Classes aren't used as frequently as structs". I guess that makes sense give how much structs can do by themselves, but it also suggests inheritance might not be used often in Swift?

One other question I have. Does Swift have abstract classes or methods?
