# Day 34 - [Project 6, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/34)

12/12 on the quiz today!

It took me a minute to figure out how to get the flag spin animation to apply only to the tapped flag and not to the others. It's a little odd that there's no conditional modifiers natively. But I guess that speaks to how you should be designing your apps.

I would actually like to see the 'correct' code for this because mine feels like I'm missing some fundamental technique with conditional modifiers. I'm tracking arrays of animation amounts in order to effectively capture the animation transition windows. But is that really necessary? I don't know.
