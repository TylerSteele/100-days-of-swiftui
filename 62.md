# 62 - [Project 13, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/62)

Ohh, the didSet on State actually tracking changes to the State struct is a problem I encountered earlier. This makes sense.

Yeah I see back on day 28 I completed a challenge using onChange, but then switched to using a computed property instead. I would be interested in the performance implications of onChange vs didSet vs computed properties. I'm guessing onChange is more intensive but it allows you to do more.

The confirmation dialog is nice and easy to use. Not much to say about that.
