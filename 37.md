# Day 37 - [Project 7, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/37)

I'm very sleepy right now, but this was a good lesson. I enjoyed learning about Identifiable, Observable, and Codable. These are the sort of thngs that other tutorials will assume you'll already know about, so having the berakdowns is super helpful.

I decided tomorrow I won't do a new day and instead will just focus on finishing day 35. I keep meaning to do that and a new lesson in the day, but I'm never up for it. I also want to do the project while it's fresh in my mind.
