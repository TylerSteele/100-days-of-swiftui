# Day 3 - [Operators and conditions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/3)

I'm on vacation at a Vermont house so it was difficult to find time to complete the course and submit the journal entry. However, with the mobile app, I've been able to complete lessons here and there throughout the day.

For today, I learned about the syntax for Swift's operators and conditions. The most notable thing is the author's opinion on ternary operators. He says you should never use them, which I get, but I think the problem in Swift specifically is the lack of a good formatter. That is confounding to me and a big ding against Swift.
