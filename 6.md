# Day 6 - The Day Where I Realize I'm Following the Wrong Tutorial

Because I have been using the Unwrap app or googling "100 days of swift" to access the course material, I realize now on day 6 that I've been completing work for 100 Days of Swift, not 100 Days of Swift*UI*.

The good news is that 100 Days of Swift is slightly more aggressive to start, which means I've already covered up to day 9 in 100 Days of SwiftUI. However, I have missed the Checkpoint exercises.

For the next few days, I'm going to completet the missing checkpoints and recalibrate with the SwiftUI pace. Then, I should be all set to proceed.

I'll continue to use the app to completion. I should be able to finish that content well ahead of the 100 days.
