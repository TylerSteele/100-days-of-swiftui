# 66 - [Project 13, part 5](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/66)

For some reason I can't get some of the image filters to work. Edges just turns the image black and pixellate doesn't seem to do anything. I double checked the code, too. Maybe this is because I'm just testing in preview and not in the simulator? Nope. Same behavior in the simulator.

I need to share this because it's super weird. If I click on the purple flower picture, my app turns it upside down..?

Why??? This doesn't happen for any of the other selected images. Truly baffling.

I'm surprised he didn't comment on how annoying it would be for the app to request a review every single filter change past 20. A challenge, perhaps?
