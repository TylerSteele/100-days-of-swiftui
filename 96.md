# 96 - [Milestone: Project 19, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/96)

I like using sheets with optional values. Ooh, the detents are cool as well. I didn't know that word existed until today.

I'm surprised that Groups hasn't come up before, but I guess it makes sense to discuss it for iPad support.

It looks like ios18 did not fix the binding of environment variables :(. Still, I'm glad that there is a way around passing State properties all the way down your View tree.
