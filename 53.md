# Day 53 - [Project 11, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/53)

Okay, I do believe I get the difference between @Binding and @Bindable now. Also, we are finally covering SwiftData!

So yeah, SwiftData is really nice. Before, using SwiftData, I didn't really get the distinctions between modelContainer, modelContext, and the models and what was going on underneath. I am grateful that I'm coming to SwiftUI later in my career because if this was the first thing I was learning, I'd be missing so much going on behind the scenes.
