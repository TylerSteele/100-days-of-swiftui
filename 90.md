The background image he chose is really funny to me. This is like a Tony Hawk Pro Skater flashcard app.

He's going crazy in the last video, holy moly.

I hit another 'Cannnot typecheck in a reasonable time' error. This time, it's because my ForEach had `in: \.self` instead of `id: \.self`. That's a tough one to spot in among all of the brackets and indents. I still don't understand why that typo would manifest that way, so bizarre.
