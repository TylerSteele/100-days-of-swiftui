# 61 - [Time for SwiftData](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/61)

So today is just for an expansion on yesterday's challenge, which I haven't done yet. I resolve to spend time this Sunday completing challenge 1 and 2. Later, I will complete this challenge and the SwiftData portion. It's a little surprising that this is a separate part of the challenge.

I was already envisioning supporting SwiftData when the challeng was described yesterday. I'm sure it'll end up being more complex than I'm thinking.

## Sunday Update

I completed challenge 3 (when I said challenge 1 and 2 above, I meant challenge 3 and 4). So I still need to complete challenge 4, 5, and 6.

Here's some screenshots of challenge 4:
