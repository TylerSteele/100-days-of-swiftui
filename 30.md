# Day 30 - [Project 5, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/30)

This app could genuinely be a fun game with a few more scoring / timing features. It makes me wonder what other word games I could easily make with swift, like my favorite, [Last Word](https://www.foddy.net/lastword/) by Bennett Foddy.

The whole `NSRange` stuff is confusing. I wish that was explained in more depth. Or maybe I just need to read the exlpanation again.
