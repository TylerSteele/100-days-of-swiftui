# Day 23 - [Project 3, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/23)

I really like the pacing of this course, how it's back to back projects but the first section of each is learning that we will apply in the project. Software developers are lucky that we can immediatley apply so much of what we learn.

I really liked seeing the type printed out and learning that generics are how view modifiers extend the base view struct. It's also good to know that inline ternaries are more performant than if statements wrapping different versions of a view.

Views as properties is great, but I need to develop a better understanding of when to create a view as a property versus not.
