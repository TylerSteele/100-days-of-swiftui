# Day 49 - [Project 10, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/49)

I'm excited to get into network requests and data! We are approaching what feels like the final bits of critical knowlege required to build 80% of apps.

I was a little disappointed that form validation stopped at disabling the button, which is not a user-friendly way of communicating that changes are needed in a form. But I'm optimistic that we'll get into better validation techniques later.

Side note: I still haven't worked on either MultiplicationMadness or the habit tracking app. I'm going to schedule a weekend day when I can catch up on these projects.
