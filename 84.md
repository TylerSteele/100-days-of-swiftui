# 84 - [Project 16, part 6](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/84)

My M1 mac with 8gb ram is really struggling with XCode. I think an upgrade is in order.

The QR code preview does have the smoothing fuzziness. I wonder if there's a way to remove that.

Notifications are working! I have always found notifications to be underwhelming in terms of their stickiness. Like, I want to be reminded multiple times if I don't acknowlege a notification. I suppose this is up to the individual app to configure, so I'll be sure to support it.
