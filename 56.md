# 56 - [Project 11, part 4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/56)

I took last week off because I had a work trip and didn't bring my personal laptop with me. Still, I should be on track for completion before Thanksgiving.

^^^ I wrote this last Monday, before settling into a bad cold (Covid? Flu? All of the above?) that I brought back home with me from my trip. So last week I was too fatigued, uncomfy, or foggy to commit to this.

^^^^^^ I wrote this yesterday before my dog threw up and I had to clean it up. Sooo now I'm starting 2 weeks and 1 day late. But it sort of works out because now I have precisely enough days to finish before my deadline. I will have to commit time on the weekend to catch up on the projects. But now that my back is against the pie wall, I'll have no choice but to buck up.

I got 11/12 on the quiz. Not bad for being away for so long!

Completed the challenges. It actually wasn't too bad getting back into this. It's really nice to have all of the prior projects as references.
