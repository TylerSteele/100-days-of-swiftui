# Day 13 - [Protocols and extensions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/13)

When I started using Swift, I was sort of confused by the lack of typing flexibility: generics, unions, etc. It seems like `extensions` fill all of those gaps for me in a really neat way.

And wow, I love this:

> Notice how the method has slightly different naming now: when we return a new value we used trimmed(), but when we modified the string directly we used trim(). This is intentional, and is part of Swift’s design guidelines: if you’re returning a new value rather than changing it in place, you should use word endings like ed or ing, like reversed().

I think I'm going to adopt this for my own function names from now on.

I also really appreciate that tip about using `extension` to preserve the default initializer.

This experience is reinforcing the idea that, while Swift is extremely well designed and tidy, new languages don't read well to those who don't understand the fundamentals. You can guess at the meaning, but it's so beneficial to understand the reasoning behind the keywords.
