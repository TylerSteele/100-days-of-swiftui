# Day 1

This first day was a breeze, just covering basic variables and typing. I did learn something surprising, which is that Swift doesn't support union types:

```swift
// This is not a thing!
var id: Int | String = "123"
```

There are some hacky enum ways to achieve this, but I think the real solution is to avoid this design in the first place.
