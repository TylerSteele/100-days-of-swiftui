# Day 5 - [Functions](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/5)

This is getting exciting with all of the neat syntax for distinct internal and external parameter names, variadic functions, inout parameters, and throws. I appreciate how declaritive Swift forces you to be and the reinforcement at time of running a function to remind you of the expected behavior ('you need to pass this parameter with &', 'this requires a do/catch', etc.).

I can think of cases in other languages (JS / Python) where these baked in safety measures would have saved me some heartache.
