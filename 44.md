# Day 43 - [Project 9, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/44)

The pathing logic is cool. I imagine you don't need to use Ints for it?

Yes, it's immediately covered next :) Type erasers seem like something I'd like to know how to make myself. I often feel the urge to make a String | Number type like what you'd do in Python.

Oh wow, I can't believe we haven't covered @Binding yet. I'm pretty sure I'm using that in the Multiplication project.

It's interesting that you can do `.removeAll` on an array instead of just `= []`. Looks like this function exists for the sake of the `keepingCapacity` argument. It also seems like the performance difference is negligible. But the Apple docs say it's `Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the collection.` which would be way worse than `= []`, right? Maybe it's only O(n) when `keepingCapacity` is `True`, and that makes the worst case O(n).

One question on storing the NavigationPath, is there some way for us to extend NavigationPath to make sure it conforms to Codable? We know that that requirement exists, so why not now disallow non-Codable data in the path?
