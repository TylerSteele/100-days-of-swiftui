# Day 40 - [Project 8, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/40)

I took yesterday off, but not really because I made great progress on the multiplication app. I'll be able to finish that soon.

60 days from today is October 17, 2024, which gives me a comfortable 2 week buffer. But I need to be careful not to burn it too early.

I love how easy it is to load JSON. I also appreciate that Swift is just using JSON and not some new proprietary thing.

I like that generics derive the type from the explicit type of the assigned variable. That's pretty neat.
