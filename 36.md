# Day 36 - [Project 7, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/36)

Ayyy finally going to learn what Observable means :)

It is so cool that you can expand macros with Observation.

This lesson was great, I feel like I'm finally digging into what I need to build my app. I know that SwiftData is yet to come, though, and that's really what I'm after.
