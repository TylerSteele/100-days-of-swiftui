# 70 - [Project 14, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/70)

It's cool working with the Map. I don't know if I'll ever use it in an app, but it's so accessible that if I do find a use for it then it should be easy to implement.

Again, I really appreciate the lessons that are just "Let's clean up this code". It helps me shift gears from 'learning mode' to 'developer mode' to get a sense what it would be like build an app for production.

I love that in the .sheet closure it's assured that place is defined. A lesser language would still have the develop confirm place isn't nil before continuing.

Huh, @escaping is pretty interesting. Not sure I get that. I guess Swift plans on releasing passed functions on close of the function unless you indicate that they will be used later.
