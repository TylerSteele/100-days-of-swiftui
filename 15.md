# Day 15 - [Swift Review](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/15)

Here's some things I missed:

- Booleans have a `.toggle()` method. Nice!
- Using `.contains()` on a set is a constant operation (Set is implemented as a hash table).
- When using SwiftUI, when I see a value like this `.darkBlue`, it means it's an enum value!
- It's interesting that Swift makes you call the super class's initializer at the end of your init. This could be done automatically, but I suppose the intention is to keep it explicit and force the developer to consciously 'opt in'. Oh, I guess you do need to pass in the parameters if there are any.
- Protocols don't only enforce the type and position of parameters, but also the names. This seems unnecessary but I like it. Although it could be annoying if you are writing a protocol that has to apply to a third party function and your own if you don't like the third party naming.
- I'm really only just realizing that Swift uses `nil`, not `null`.
