# Day 46 - [Project 9, part 4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/46)

Scored 12/12 on the quiz! I feel like I retained this chapter better because it seems so useful.

That final challenge was tough, using NavigationLink(value:). It was a bit confusing that, once you're using the value paramater, label becomes the first trailing closure, so you don't need the `label: ` label anymore. But it's really nice now that it's set up!
