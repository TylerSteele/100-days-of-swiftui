# 85 - [Project 16, part 7](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/85)

I scored 11/12 on the test.

I started doing the second challenge by adding a State vars for name, emailAddress, and isContacted, before remembering that I can just use Bindable to make the updates directly to the model. This seems like something I'll forget again in the future, but I'm learning.

My preview wasn't working because I had

```swift
let container = try ModelContainer(for: Prospect.self, configuration: config)
```

instead of

```swift
let container = try ModelContainer(for: Prospect.self, configurations: config)
```

Catch the difference? It took me a long time to. Especially because the error Swift caught was at the later return statement for the view "Cannot use explicit 'return' statement in the body of result builder 'ViewBuilder'".

Fun fun fun.

I needed to write a schema migration just to add a dateAdded property to the model (in order to sort by when a Prospect was added). Maybe I'm missing something, but this seems a bit extra... I really wish I could just tell XCode "Forget about the existng model, wipe the slate clean." but I'm not seeing how to do that.

I keep getting the error

> The compiler is unable to type-check this expression in reasonable time

Which I thought was due to performance limitations of my M1 or something, so I kept breaking out subviews. It turns out, nope, I have an actual error.

I was trying to do this

```swift
Picker("Sort", selection: $sortOrder) {
    Text("Sort by Name")
        .tag([SortDescriptor(\Prospect.name)])
    Text("Sort by Most Recent")
        .tag([])
}
```

In order to 'unset' sort order (so I can avoid a new dateAdded model property) and .tag([]) is not valid, apparently. Why can't Xcode tell me that instead of wasting my time with the 'compiler is unable to type-check' message? Ridiculous.

Unsetting sortOrder and defaulting back to the original is quite the puzzle.

I figured it out by making my sortOrder State optional, but it was for nothing because the default sort order _is_ by name, not by recently added. So I need to do the schema migration after all. Wow, SwiftUI is getting on my nervs today!! :)

It was so much effort to get the sort by date added working, I'm questioning if I'm doing it in a more complicated way than is necessary. I had to:

- Add dateAdded to the Prospect model
- Create version schemas and a migration for setting a default value to dateAdded
- Move the Query into a new sub View called ProspectsListView so that state changes to sortOrder actually updated the list.

Granted, I could see all of this being required to get this working, but I question if it's the intention of the course for me to do all of that just for one portion of a challenge.
