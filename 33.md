# Day 33 - [Project 6, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/33)

One third of the way through (if we are casting to an Int). It feels like it's gone by faster than I thought, but it also feels like doing two more of what I've done already is a lot. Still, it's nice to have an almost daily ritual to measure the passage of time against. I suspect the next 67 days will fly by.

I'm really excited to explore all of the different gestures! These options offer almost enough inspiration to make apps based on them. Same can be said about transitions. And the combination of both.
