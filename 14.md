# Day 14 - [Optionals](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/14)

What can I say, I love optionals! I'm glad Swift has null coalescing and optional chaining. One thing I haven't seen before is the `try?` pattern. I can see where it would be useful, but it also seems easy to abuse in a way that would obscure valuable errors. I would want to be selective about my use of that.
