# 83 - [Project 16, part 5](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/83)

I have never considered that QR codes would be used with plain strings, I've only ever seen them assossiated with a URL (or so I thought?). I guess when you scan a QR code there could be more going on than I imagined.

I'm having issues with the NavigationStacks and navigation title /bar displaying.
I thought it might be because we shouldn't be using multiple NavigationStacks, but reducing it down to one in ContentView doesn't help. Ah! I figured it out! It's because in PropspectsView I placed the .navigationTitle and the toolbar within the List (on each iterable). But, the list is empty to start, so they were never being set.

This is very nice code to have handy as a reference. I think it's worth doing this 100 days of SwiftUI if only to have a catalog with all of these working examples handy. I should be able to use these to stitch together 80% of apps.
