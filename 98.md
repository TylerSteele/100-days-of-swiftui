# 98 - [Milestone: Project 19, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/98)

It is wild how easy it is to add search. I want to make every list searchable now.

Using a `fatalError` when a facility type isn't recognized seems a bit over the top. I guess it makes sense for static data, but if it were live then this seems like a place where silently failing and hiding that facility type (or just not providing a default icon) would be fine.

I finished the videos but I'm getting a build error to do with List(filteredResorts) saying that the passed value shoud be bindable, which just is not true? So I'm going to come back to this tomorrow and figure it out then.

I figured that it must be some miniscule syntax error that's _actually_ the problem, so I copied and pasted files wholesale from Paul's repo. It's really sad to me that the compiler is so bad that I need to resort to that, but hey it's working now.
