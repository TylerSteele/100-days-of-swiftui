# Day 17 - [Project 1, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/17)

I did miss a day because I was falling asleep yesterday working on this. My lesson is that I need to get this done earlier in the day while I have more energy.

This was satisfying to take what I've learned and apply it to an 'actual' app. There are some things I dislike, like the fact that `numberOfPeople` is actually `numberOfPeopleMinusTwo` because of how the picker with the range is working. Surely there's a better way of handling that?

On a related note, inside the `totalPerPerson` computed value, there's all of these local variables that have basically the same name as the state variables, so it would be very easy (and I did this) to refer to the state variable instead of the local variable. I'm inclined to use the same name and append the type like `tipPercentageDouble` but that feels clunky. Hopefully there's some better way of addressing this.
