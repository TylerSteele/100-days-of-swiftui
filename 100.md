# 100 - [Final exam](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/100)

I made it!! I just want to reflect on my time here and how far I've come. This challenge was not particulary hard in its content or the material covered. There were certain challenging concepts here and there, but the real challenge was in my commitment to the cause. I did have to mave the finish line once, but what matters is persistence over perfection.

I scored a 94/100 on the final exam! Woohoo! I'll have to add my certificate to the readme :)
