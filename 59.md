# 59 - [Project 12, part 3](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/59)

I missed yesterday because I had to help my wife on my lunch break and then after work I went to a concert. I saw Briston Maroney, they were great! WHY NOT opened and they were also really good. Their audio was too loud (typical for openers), but they still put on a great show.

I heard a great piece of advice from Leo Vader on the MinnMax podcast. He talked about how, in order to hold himself accountable to his daily writing goals, he has to either write or journal about why he's not writing. This feels like something I can adopt for this, or my other daily challenges. If I miss a day, simply record and explain why. If my explanation is something to do with spending time living my life fully, then it's a day worth missing. If my exlanaition is that I played video games all day, then I can reflect on what prevented me from using some of that time more wisely.

Another neat trick about this is that it gives me a choice. I can choose to journal. How much more difficult is it, though, to actually just do the work? Now, the comparison point is not doing nothing, but it's doing something requiring a similar amount of time and attention.

I got 10/12 on the quiz. Not bad.

For the challenges, I already was filtering by expense type for each individual list. A UI element didn't really make sense for my layout because I don't display each type alongside oneanother. Instead, I updated the filtering logic to be in the query instead of in the render.
