# Day 47 - [Milestone: Projects 7-9](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/47)

Wow, so today's challenge app of building a habit tracking app is actually the app I want to build! It's what led me on this journey! So I look forward to having a starting point.

Also, given that I still haven't finished the last milestone, my goal today is to wrap that up. Then I will work on this milestone in my spare time on coming days.

I made good progress here. It took me a long time to figure out how to display a multiline message in an alert. The lesson is that you can only really use a single Text view for a message. However, you can generate a string that includes line breaks. I strive to complete the multiplication app tomorrow.
