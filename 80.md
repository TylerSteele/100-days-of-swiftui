# 80 - [Project 16, part 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/80)

Result is very similar to the Zod schema. I suppose they are both implementations of the same underlying concept: union types that account for multiple possible states of a value.

I'll need interpolation .none in my app because I plan to include low resolution sprites.

It's interesting that, on context menus, he says

> Donâ€™t repeat options the user can already see elsewhere in your UI

But, because they are hidden by default, wouldn't you want the option to be discoverable elsewhere? I feel like context menus should be reserved for 'power user' functionality. You can use a context menu to delete a podcast episode, or you can tap on the episode, go to the episode view, and tap the garbage can icon.

Something I truly despise about Apple UI sensibility are UI elements hidden behind keyboard shortcuts. I need to google how to extend (maybe it's mirror, something like that?) a display in my MacOS settings because the element to do that doesn't appear unless you press some combination of keys that I never remember. How can they justify this from a capital A Accessibility perspective? Nevermind lowercase a accessibility... Infuriating. And a little insulting that Apple doesn't trust me to use the full suite of tools that exist.
