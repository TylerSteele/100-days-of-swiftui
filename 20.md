# Day 20 - [Project 2, part 1](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20)

This tip is very helpful in improving my ability to read Swift code:

> Tip: When we were using the background() modifier, SwiftUI was able to figure out that .red actually meant Color.red. When weâ€™re using the color as a free-standing view Swift has no context to help it figure out what .red means so we need to be specific that we mean Color.red.

I sort of figured this out already, that if the class (struct?) name is implied, you can just do `.property`. After learning about Swift, it was still confusing to see examples of `.property` all over the place because it doesn't apparently map to any of the learned concepts.

Learning about button and gradient options is nice. I like the lack of customization options, which is to say I like the amount of work that's done for you and how easy it is to make a basic, good looking interface without going off the rails. This is part of why I'm learning Swift and not Flutter.

I also really appreciate the alert lesson because it helped me finally understand the meaning of _Views are a function of our program state_. There's no arbitrary function invocation to affect the views. The views are directly tied to the state of the application. This is really refreshing comming from React / JS where there's a lot of potential for opaque logic.
