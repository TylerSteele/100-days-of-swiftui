# 89 - [Project 17, part 4](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/89)

I can't figure out how to get the environment overrides working in Xcode. I hate the lack of confidence in whether something is a knowlege gap and whether it's an Xcode bug. Googling Xcode issues is often underwhelming, too. I could get it working in the Simulator, at least, just by going into the Settings app.

Huh, now it is working but I don't know what I changed. Well, it's letting me set the settings, but I don't see them reflected in the preview.

I wonder if we could remove the need for the isActive state by just creating a computed property of `scenePhase == .active && !cards.isEmpty`.

That does work! Yay! Hopefully some later code changes don't mean I'll have to revert that...
