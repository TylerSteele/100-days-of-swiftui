Why is .black an option for fontWeight?? Am I missing something?

Oh, I realize now that my preview was crashing last time because of the missing modelContainer in the preview. Interesting that it wasn't covered yesterday. I am proud to say I was able to fix it with my newfound knowlege!

SwiftData is great. It really is feeling like SwiftUI will work perfectly for 80% of apps. I'm curious to see how it fares with the other 20%, though.
